# liri-node-app

This is a node js application that uses the command line to search for Movies, Music and upcoming concerts. This application was developed to practice making node cli applications, using npm packages, and making axios calls.

After the required dependancies have been installed the program can be started by typing 'node liri.js' in the terminal. Once this is done the user will be presented the following list of options:

Concert-This
Spotify-This-Song
Movie-This
Do-What-It-Says
Quit
